<img align="right" src="https://wjdgks300.github.com/image/" />

 my name is jeong han. I currently work at a robotics company, Clobot, and my main area of interest is computer vision. My primary programming language is C++, and I am also learning Python.

 I am currently studing computer vision, focusing on areas such as image processing, object detection, and classification. I am particularly interested in the latest advancements in deep learning and how they can be applied to solve complex computer vision challenges.

I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in this field. I am always eager to learn from others and collaborate on interesting projects.
